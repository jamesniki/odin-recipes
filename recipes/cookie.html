<h2>Description</h2>

<p>This recipe is fantastic for whenever you're craving both a soft and chewy
    cookie with tons of chocolate. It may not be the healthiest, but you
    wouldn't be here if you were looking for a salad!</p>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>

<ul>
    <li>3/4 cup brown sugar</li>
    <li>1/2 cup unsalted butter, at room temperature</li>
    <li>1/2 cup white sugar</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>1 large egg</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
    <li>1.5 cups all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>3/4 teaspoon baking soda</li>
    <li>1 cup milk chocolate chips</li>
    <li>1 (3 ounce) bar dark chocolate, cut into chunks</li>
    <li>3 tablespoons white chocolate chips</li>
</ul>

<h4>Steps</h4>

<ol>
    <li>Combine brown sugar, butter, white sugar, and salt in a large 
        bowl; beat with an electric mixer until a creamy, deep brown 
        mixture forms. Add egg and vanilla; beat until mixture lightens 
        and becomes smooth, 10 to 15 seconds.</li>
    <li>Mix flour and baking soda together in a separate bowl. Add slowly
        to the wet ingredients until mostly incorporated, but some white 
        traces of flour remain. Fold in milk chocolate, dark chocolate, 
        and white chocolate using a spatula, not the mixer. Cover the dough 
        and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes, or up to 48 hours.</li>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) when ready to
        bake.</li>
    <li>Divide cold dough into 2 1/4-ounce portions and place on a cookie 
        sheet.</li>
    <li>Bake in the preheated oven until the edges start to look golden 
        brown and crispy, 10 to 12 minutes. Do not overbake; the centers 
        will not look fully done. Cool until cookies are set, about 30 
        minutes.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>

<ul>
    <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>1 1/2 cups white sugar, divided</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>6 tablespoons cold butter</li>
    <li>1/4 cup boiling water</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons cornstarch</li>
    <li>1/4 cup cold water</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon lemon juice</li>
    <li>4 cups fresh blackberries, rinsed and drained</li>
</ul>

<h4>Steps</h4>

<ol>
    <li>Combine brown sugar, butter, white sugar, and salt in a large 
        bowl; beat with an electric mixer until a creamy, deep brown 
        mixture forms. Add egg and vanilla; beat until mixture lightens 
        and becomes smooth, 10 to 15 seconds.</li>
    <li>Mix flour and baking soda together in a separate bowl. Add slowly
        to the wet ingredients until mostly incorporated, but some white 
        traces of flour remain. Fold in milk chocolate, dark chocolate, 
        and white chocolate using a spatula, not the mixer. Cover the dough 
        and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes, or up to 48 hours.</li>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) when ready to
        bake.</li>
    <li>Divide cold dough into 2 1/4-ounce portions and place on a cookie 
        sheet.</li>
    <li>Bake in the preheated oven until the edges start to look golden 
        brown and crispy, 10 to 12 minutes. Do not overbake; the centers 
        will not look fully done. Cool until cookies are set, about 30 
        minutes.</li>
</ol>
